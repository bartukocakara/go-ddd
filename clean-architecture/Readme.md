# 📜 Key Principles
# 🏛️ Core Entities
Domain models are the foundation of the architecture, representing key business concepts and ensuring the primary focus remains on business logic.

# 📘 Use Cases
Encapsulate application-specific business rules, defining clear interactions between core entities. Each use case represents a cohesive unit of business functionality.

# 🌐 Delivery Layer
Handles external interactions through various interfaces, such as:

# REST APIs
Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)
gRPC Services
This layer is responsible for translating external requests into internal operations.

# 🗄️ Repositories
Manage data access and persistence. They abstract database or third-party service interactions, ensuring that business logic remains decoupled from infrastructure concerns.

# 📈 Use Cases
# 🏢 Large, Scalable Projects
Designed for applications that need to grow and evolve without compromising core functionality.
Supports complex domains by separating business logic from technical concerns, promoting clean, maintainable code.
# 🧪 Independent Testing
Core logic can be tested in isolation, without relying on external services (e.g., databases, frameworks).
Facilitates unit tests for each layer independently, improving test coverage and flexibility.
# 🔍 Why This Matters:
By applying these principles, you ensure that your application remains modular, scalable, and easy to maintain, even as it grows in complexity. Each domain operates independently, making it easier to add new features or refactor existing functionality without affecting other parts of the system.

# ✨ This structure empowers teams to deliver robust, high-quality software that can adapt to changing requirements. 🚀
