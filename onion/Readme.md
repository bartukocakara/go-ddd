# 🏗️ Onion Architecture
Onion Architecture organizes code into concentric layers, emphasizing a strong separation of concerns. The core domain logic resides at the center, while the outer layers handle infrastructure, UI, and other external concerns. This structure ensures that the business logic remains isolated and independent.

# 🧩 Key Characteristics
## 📌 Layered Approach
The architecture is structured into layers, each with distinct responsibilities:

Core (Innermost Layer): Contains the domain model and business logic.
Application Layer: Implements use cases and coordinates between the core and infrastructure.
Infrastructure Layer (Outer Layer): Interfaces with external systems such as databases, APIs, and UI frameworks.
## 🔄 Dependency Inversion
Inner layers depend on abstractions, not on outer layers.
The core domain remains independent of external frameworks, enhancing maintainability and testability.
## 🛡️ Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a specific role:

Domain Layer: Business rules and domain entities.
Application Layer: Orchestrates business logic.
Infrastructure Layer: Handles persistence, external services, and UI.
# 💼 Use Cases
## ⚙️ Complex Business Domains
Ideal for applications with intricate or evolving business rules that need clear separation between core logic and external systems.

## 📈 Long-Term Projects
Supports applications expected to evolve over time.
Enables teams to adapt to changing business requirements without significant rewrites.
## 🤝 Teams with Clear Roles
Well-suited for teams responsible for different layers, such as business logic vs. infrastructure development.

## 🎯 Benefits
Focus on Business Logic:
Keeps business rules isolated from external dependencies, ensuring the core logic remains the primary focus.

## Enhanced Maintainability:
Changes in infrastructure or UI don't affect the core business logic, simplifying updates.

## Testability:
The core domain and application logic can be easily tested independently from infrastructure concerns.

## Flexibility:
Easily replace or update infrastructure components (e.g., switch databases) without impacting core functionality.

# ✨ Why Choose Onion Architecture?
Onion Architecture promotes a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure, ensuring that your application remains adaptable, maintainable, and testable over time. 🌟
