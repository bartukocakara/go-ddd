Use Cases:
Small Projects: Ideal for projects with low complexity, allowing developers to manage all functionalities within a few files.
Prototypes and MVPs: Perfect for rapidly building prototypes or minimum viable products (MVPs), facilitating quick iterations without the need for organized folders.
Command-Line Tools: Well-suited for small command-line applications that only require a few support files, making execution and testing straightforward.
Learning and Experimentation: Beneficial for beginners who are learning a new programming language or framework, as it minimizes the complexity of file organization.
