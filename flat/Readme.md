# Flat Folder Structure Template for Go Projects

This repository demonstrates a flat folder structure for Go projects, suitable for small or straightforward applications. This structure keeps all files in the root directory, ensuring simplicity and ease of navigation.

## Use Cases

### Small Projects
Ideal for projects with low complexity, allowing developers to manage all functionalities within a few files. The flat structure avoids unnecessary complexity and deep folder nesting.

### Prototypes and MVPs
Perfect for rapidly building prototypes or minimum viable products (MVPs). The straightforward structure facilitates quick iterations and easy modifications.

### Command-Line Tools
Well-suited for small command-line applications that only require a few support files. Execution and testing are simple and efficient.

### Learning and Experimentation
Beneficial for beginners learning Go, as it minimizes the complexity of file organization. This structure helps new developers focus on coding rather than folder management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go version 1.18 or later installed. You can download Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
