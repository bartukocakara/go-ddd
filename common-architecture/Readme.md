# 🛠️ Common Architecture
Common Architecture provides a flexible and straightforward structure, ideal for smaller projects or rapid development environments. Unlike stricter architectural patterns (such as Onion or Clean Architecture), it focuses on simplicity and ease of understanding, making it perfect for quick prototyping or projects with manageable complexity.

# 🧩 Key Characteristics
## 📌 Simplicity
Organizes code into clear, logical directories without enforcing strict rules or layering, making the project easier to navigate for newcomers.

## 🧱 Single Layer of Abstraction
Unlike multi-layered architectures, a common structure typically doesn't enforce strict separation between different concerns, leading to less overhead in managing dependencies.

## 🛠️ Minimal Dependency Management
Reduces complexity by minimizing the number of abstractions, which can simplify debugging and enhance development speed.

## 🎨 Flexible Code Organization
Developers have the freedom to organize the code according to project-specific needs rather than adhering to a rigid structure. This flexibility allows for creative problem-solving.

## 💼 Use Cases
⚙️ Small to Medium Projects
Well-suited for applications where the complexity is manageable without requiring strict separation of concerns.

## 🚀 Rapid Prototyping
Facilitates quick iteration on ideas without the overhead of adhering to a formal architectural pattern, enabling faster development cycles.

## 👨‍💻 Single-Developer Projects
Perfect for individual developers who prefer a simpler, less structured environment, focusing on functionality over architecture.

## 🎓 Learning and Experimentation
Provides a good starting point for beginners learning Go or for developers experimenting with new ideas, without getting bogged down by architectural decisions.

## 🌟 Benefits
Quick Development:
Reduces setup time and allows developers to focus on core functionality immediately.

Easy to Understand:
The straightforward structure helps new developers grasp the project quickly.

Flexible and Adaptable:
Allows adjustments based on project needs, promoting creativity and innovation.

Low Overhead:
Simplifies dependency management and reduces maintenance burden.

## ⚖️ Considerations:
While this architecture offers flexibility, it may become harder to maintain or scale for larger or more complex projects. As projects grow, consider transitioning to more structured architectures like Onion or Clean Architecture to maintain scalability and separation of concerns.

## ✨ Why Choose Common Architecture?
For smaller projects or rapid prototypes, Common Architecture provides an agile and developer-friendly approach, focusing on simplicity and flexibility without sacrificing functionality. 🌟
